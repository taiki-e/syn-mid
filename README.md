Providing the features between "full" and "derive" of syn.

This crate provides the following two unique data structures.

- `syn_mid::ItemFn` -- A function whose body is not parsed.

  ```text
  fn process(n: usize) -> Result<()> { ... }
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^     ^
  ```

- `syn_mid::Block` -- A block whose body is not parsed.

  ```text
  { ... }
  ^     ^
  ```

Other data structures are the same as data structures of [syn]. These are
defined in this crate because they cannot be used in [syn] without "full"
feature.
