Providing the features between "full" and "derive" of syn.

This crate provides the following two unique data structures.

* `syn_mid::ItemFn` -- A function whose body is not parsed.

  ```text
  fn process(n: usize) -> Result<()> { ... }
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^     ^
  ```

* `syn_mid::Block` -- A block whose body is not parsed.

  ```text
  { ... }
  ^     ^
  ```

Other data structures are the same as data structures of [syn]. These are defined in this crate because they cannot be used in [syn] without "full" feature.

[syn]: https://github.com/dtolnay/syn

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
syn-mid = "0.2"
```

The current version of syn-mid requires Rust 1.15 or later.

* **`clone-impls`** *(enabled by default)* â€” Clone impls for all syntax tree
  types.
