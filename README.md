<!-- tidy:crate-doc:start -->
Providing the features between "full" and "derive" of syn.

This crate provides the following two unique data structures.

- [`syn_mid::ItemFn`] -- A function whose body is not parsed.

  ```text
  fn process(n: usize) -> Result<()> { ... }
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^     ^
  ```

- [`syn_mid::Block`] -- A block whose body is not parsed.

  ```text
  { ... }
  ^     ^
  ```

Other data structures are the same as data structures of [syn]. These are
defined in this crate because they cannot be used in [syn] without "full"
feature.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
syn-mid = "0.5"
```

*Compiler support: requires rustc 1.56+*

[**Examples**](https://github.com/taiki-e/syn-mid/tree/HEAD/examples)

## Optional features

- **`clone-impls`** â€” Clone impls for all syntax tree types.
